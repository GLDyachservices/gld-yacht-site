      <h1>About GLD</h1>
      <p>
        GLD Yacht Management was established in 2023 on the storied shores of Martha’s Vineyard by Dylan Biggs, Gustav Hallgren, and Landon Cormie. With years of experience in maritime operations and high-end yacht services, the founders share a singular vision: to redefine what discerning yacht owners expect from a management partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        From day one, our mission has been uncompromising complete client satisfaction through bespoke, detail-driven service. We don’t just manage yachts, we manage trust and long term relationships built on consistency and results.
      </p>

        At GLD, clients are more than contracts; they are partners. Our personalized approach ensures that every service, from daily maintenance to seasonal logistics, is delivered with the utmost precision and care. Expect nothing less than exceptional quality, seamless operations, and peace of mind on every nautical mile.
